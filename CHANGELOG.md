# Changelog

## Unreleased

- 「打开配置文件夹」 opens the right folder in the Store edition (#45). Windows keeps what a Store app writes under %APPDATA% in the package's own `LocalCache\Roaming` folder, and Explorer cannot see the file at the %APPDATA% path, so the button opened Documents. The settings page (and `pecofence-cli status` / `paths`) now show the real location, and the button opens it with config.json selected.
- Renaming an icon that only administrators may change, such as a shortcut installed for all users (it lives on the Public Desktop), asks for permission the way Explorer does (#48): 「你需要提供管理员权限才能重命名此文件」 with 继续, instead of failing with 「拒绝访问」. The icon keeps its fence. pecofence-cli `item rename` still reports the error without a prompt.

## 0.1.4

- More ways to colour fences and read their titles (#40). 「只给标题栏上色」 in 栅栏选项 puts a fence's tint on its title row only, so the icons sit on plain glass that blends with the desktop. On a fence with tabs, 「标签页颜色」 gives each tab its own colour bar under its name (it follows the tint until you pick one). 「标题字号」 has a fourth size, 「特大」 (18 instead of 16), for fence and tab titles on high-resolution screens. pecofence-cli: `fence set <fence> tintTitleOnly true`, `tabColor "#RRGGBB"`, `titleSize extraLarge`.
- The 「桌面」 fence can hide while it is empty (#39). It cannot be deleted, because new desktop icons land in it, so its menu has 「为空时自动隐藏」 where other fences have 「删除栅栏」 (also in 栅栏选项, and `fence set inbox hideWhenEmpty true` in pecofence-cli). Once its last icon is moved out, it fades away; it comes back at the same spot as soon as something lands in it, such as a new file on the desktop or an icon dragged back there.
- Unplugging or plugging in a monitor keeps the fences apart and where you put them (#24). Every screen setup shows the same fences: one made, renamed or filled on the laptop is there when the external monitor is back. Each setup remembers where the fences sit, so plugging the monitor back in puts every fence back, and unplugging it again brings back the laptop arrangement. Another resolution or scale counts as another setup too: switching a 4K screen to 1080p for a game no longer squeezes the 4K arrangement for good (a taskbar that moves or grows does not count). The first time a setup appears, fences on the screens that stay keep their spots and the ones from the missing screen move into free space (with no room left, a fence stays where it lands). PecoFence waits a second for the monitors to settle before it moves anything, and it knows a monitor by its model and connection, so a dock or another port no longer looks like a new screen. Configurations from 0.1.3 and earlier kept separate fences per setup; the first start merges them so that no fence is lost (a fence deleted on only one setup comes back once).
- 0.1.3 and earlier show no fences with a configuration this version has saved, because they do not know monitors by model. The fences come back with this version; to go back for good, restore a backup from before the upgrade (see UPGRADING.md).
- pecofence-cli: monitor ids (`monitor list`, `fence create --monitor`) are the monitor's own, such as `GSM7787#5&2C948443&0&UID24832`, instead of `\\.\DISPLAY1`.
- 「检查更新」 in Settings → 关于 asks GitHub whether a newer release is out; nothing is checked until you click it. The installed edition then downloads the new setup and runs it: PecoFence closes, setup replaces the files and opens PecoFence again (and reopens the old version if the update fails). The ZIP edition opens the download page instead; the Store edition updates through the Store and shows no button.
- Releases include a Windows installer, `pecofence-v<version>-x64-setup.exe`, next to the ZIP, which is now named `pecofence-v<version>-x64-portable.zip`. Setup installs for the current user without administrator rights, adds a Start menu entry (a desktop shortcut is optional) and an uninstaller that keeps your settings. The installed copy and the ZIP share the same settings in `%APPDATA%\PecoFence`, and setup can install into a folder the ZIP was extracted into, replacing the program files there.
- The wording in all ten languages was reviewed across the app, the website, the Store listing and the READMEs: stiff and literal phrases are rewritten, Windows' own terms are used (Strg / Suppr / Supr key names in German, French and Spanish menus, 「速览栅栏」 for Peek and 「收起」 for rolling up in Simplified Chinese), and each thing has one name everywhere (the Store copy now calls fences fences, as the app does). German uses "du" throughout.
- 「展开时把下面的栅栏推开」 (on by default, `rollUp.pushNeighbors`): when a rolled-up fence expands, on hover or with a click, the fences stacked below it slide down out of its way and slide back when it rolls up. They keep their saved positions, so a fence left expanded still pushes them after a restart. Pushed fences stay on their screen and inside its work area, locked fences and fences being dragged stay put, and moving the pointer from the expanded fence onto one it pushed keeps it open. Switched off, an expanding fence stops short of the next fence below, as before. Contributed by Jhon Nguyen.
- 「新建」 ▸ Folder / Tab are singular again in every language. Snapshot cards, rule descriptions, the import / restore notifications and their automatic snapshots are whole sentences in each language instead of joined pieces (no more 「3 フェンス」, «1 областей» or `Completed: Import configuration`), and the rule size unit follows the language (Mo, МБ). The note that appearance applies to the whole tab group only shows on fences with tabs.
- Outlook mail dragged onto a folder portal, onto a folder icon inside a fence, or onto any fence is saved as in Explorer: each message becomes `<subject>.msg` with its contents and attachments, and attachments dragged on their own become files. On a fence whose icons live on the desktop, the file lands on the desktop and joins that fence. Files dragged out of a zip archive work the same way. PecoFence hands drops that carry no plain files to the folder's own Explorer drop handler, so name collisions, progress and the right-button menu are Explorer's.
- Apps dragged from the Start menu onto a fence become working shortcuts, as on the desktop. They used to point to a made-up path such as `C:\{7C5A40EF-…}\Steam\steam.exe`, and opening one showed 「Windows 正在查找 steam.exe」; shortcuts made that way before have to be dragged in again.
- Fences no longer float over other windows while a program running as administrator (an elevated VS Code or terminal, a screenshot tool) is the lowest window above the desktop. Windows refused to put a fence below such a window, so fences that had just started, or come back from Peek, stayed on top of every app.
- 「反馈」 in Settings (and 「发送反馈…」 in the tray menu) sends a problem report or an idea straight to the developer, with an optional email for a reply. It is filed as an issue in a private repository; apart from 「检查更新」, nothing else in PecoFence uses the network.
- 「附带诊断日志（不含个人信息）」, on by default, adds the version, Windows build, scaling, language and the shareable log. That log is written beside the normal one and holds only the app's own fixed messages, numbers and error codes: file and folder names, paths and fence names never reach it (a source scan in the tests enforces this). 「查看要发送的内容」 shows exactly what goes out.
- After a crash, the next start shows a notification; clicking it opens the feedback page with the crashed run's log attached.
- The previous run's log is kept as `pecofence.prev.log`. Starting PecoFence while it is already running no longer empties the running instance's log.
- pecofence-cli: `paths` also lists `previousLog` and `shareLog`.
- 「添加规则」 on the 「整理规则」 page adds the rule again. Clicking it did nothing for any kind of rule, so only the quick-add buttons and pecofence-cli could create rules (#33).
- Rules on the creation time made on the 「整理规则」 page are saved. They used to show up in the list but were never stored, and while one was in the list no other rule change was stored either.
- Documents saved in Word, Excel or PowerPoint stay in their fence. These programs save by renaming the document to a temporary name and a fresh copy to the document's name, and the document used to drop out of its fence and be filed again by the rules on every save.
- Desktops and folders whose path contains a letter such as the Turkish 「İ」 work: their icons were blank, and opening, renaming or deleting them failed.
- Importing a configuration or restoring a backup shows the files of its folder portals right away. A restored portal used to stay empty until something changed in its folder.
- Deleting the first tab of a tab group keeps the other tabs together in its place. They used to become separate fences stacked on the same spot.
- Dragging a fence onto a monitor with a different scale merges it as a tab when it is dropped on another fence's title, and the other selected fences that moved with it keep their new positions after a restart.
- With the right mouse button set as the primary button, double-clicking the desktop (quick hide) and dragging on it (selecting fences, drawing a new fence) use that button.
- Files copied onto a fence all land in it when the copy takes longer than 15 seconds. The later ones used to go where the rules put them.
- A crash could leave the desktop icons hidden after 「隐藏 Windows 桌面图标」 had been turned off and on, or a shutdown had been cancelled: two watchdogs restored the icons at once and undid each other.
- Renaming an icon to its own name in lower case (README → readme) renames the file. It used to do nothing.
- pecofence-cli: `fence create --portal` resolves a relative folder such as `.` against the current directory, not PecoFence's.
- PecoFence closes when Windows asks it to: for a Store update, an installer, or the end of the session. It used to keep running, so Windows waited, ended it by force and reported it as not responding. After an update, PecoFence starts again by itself.

## 0.1.3

- 「显示标题栏」 per fence (fence options, `fence set <FENCE> titleOnHover default|hover|always`): each fence can fold its title row away until the pointer is over it, or always show it, whatever 「鼠标悬停时才显示标题栏」 says; fences left at 「跟随常规设置」 (`default`) keep following that setting. A fully transparent fence with a hover-only title shows nothing but its icons at rest.
- The tray icon comes back after Explorer restarts or crashes. It used to stay gone until PecoFence was restarted, and every notification went with it; an icon that could not be added at logon is retried too.
- A `config.json` this version cannot read (one written by a newer version, or a hand edit gone wrong) is kept as `config.unreadable-<date>-<n>.json` next to it, with a notification. It used to be rotated into `config.bak` and deleted by the second save.
- Files dropped on a fence from another drive or a network share are copied, as in Explorer; from the same drive they are still moved. Shift forces a move, Ctrl a copy.
- 「删除栅栏」 asks first when the fence still holds icons or rules point to it, saying how many icons go back to the 「桌面」 fence and how many rules are deleted (「否」 is the default). An empty fence without rules is still deleted at once.
- Ctrl+dragging an icon of a multi-selection copies the whole selection, as in Explorer; a Ctrl-click without a drag still deselects the icon.
- When a shutdown is cancelled (or another program refuses it), the real desktop icons are hidden again. They used to stay visible next to the fences.
- The settings window fits small high-DPI screens (1366×768 at 125 %, 1080p at 175 %); its title bar could open above the top of the screen, where it could not be dragged back.
- A fence dragged onto a monitor with a different scale stays under the cursor instead of jumping away from it.
- After a graphics driver reset, fences that cannot get a new GPU device right away try again (after 1, 2, 4 … up to 30 seconds) instead of staying blank until PecoFence is restarted.
- The icon menu no longer lists 「打开」 and 「删除」 twice (PecoFence's and Explorer's); 「打开」 is the bold default item.
- Rule descriptions on the settings page use the interface language's list separator and quotation marks, and "AND" no longer runs into the word before it (`Installationspakete, Archive UND …`).
- Creating more than 64 fences from the desktop, a menu or a template is refused with a notification; a 65th fence used to make every later save fail. Desktops with more than 5000 items no longer stop saving either.
- pecofence-cli: restoring the oldest automatic snapshot works. The restore's own backup used to delete it first and report `snapshot_not_found`.
- pecofence-cli: settings nothing acts on (`quickHide.delayMs`, `rollUp.hoverOpenMs`, `telemetry` and nine more) are no longer shown by `settings get` and `describe --schema`, and `settings set` refuses them (`invalid_path`). They stay in `config.json` so older versions can still read it.

## 0.1.2

- Liquid Glass reworked after kube.io's refraction model: the face of a fence stays perfectly clear and all the bending sits in the rim, where a convex squircle bezel refracts the wallpaper with Snell's law (index 1.5). The very edge mirrors the backdrop like thick glass, and the magnification eases out over 40 DIP so no inner frame shows between the rim and the clear face. A thin specular ring is filled with the refracted wallpaper's colour, strongly saturated. The old material's whole-panel warp, blur and colour fringes are gone, and Liquid Glass corners are now 16 DIP. Moving a fence draws faster (one displacement pass instead of three), and GPU memory peaks lower while arranging fences (about 160 instead of 450 MB with 7 fences on a 4K monitor).
- Fences line up when resized, whatever their icon size, spacing or view: a dragged edge, top and bottom included, snaps to other fences' edges (level, or a gap apart) and to the work area's edges, with alignment guides, also with 「调整大小时保持为整数个图标」 on. Away from them that option still sizes to whole columns and rows; at a height of no whole rows the rows share the space left over like the columns share the width, so a fence still shows whole icons only. Dragged edges, expanding a rolled fence and the automatic size changes stop exactly a gap short of the next fence instead of a whole row short. Switching the option on, a late DPI change at logon, tab changes and restoring a layout no longer re-round sizes; changing a fence's icon size, spacing, view or label lines still does (#1).
- Tab names no longer vanish on a narrow fence: squeezed tab pills give up their padding (down to 8 DIP) before a caption is shortened with an ellipsis.
- Alignment guides while dragging (「显示对齐参考线」, `snapping.guideLines`, on for new configurations): thin white lines along the edges a moved or resized fence lines up with, and along the screen's centre line when it snapped there.
- Dragged fences also snap to the screen's centre lines (centred horizontally / vertically on the work area). Holding Alt while dragging or resizing moves freely, without snapping.
- When a dragged fence's title is over another fence's title, that fence gets the white outline: releasing there adds the dragged fence to it as a tab. The outline used to disappear in that spot, which looked like a glitch.
- The drop outline no longer stays on screen after a Liquid Glass drag is cancelled with Esc or a right-click, and no longer flashes on top of the dragged fence every two seconds (the desktop-layer check took it for a foreign window).
- The 「在此新建栅栏」 menu that appears after drawing a rectangle on the empty desktop closes again when you click elsewhere or press Esc. It used to stay open until its item was chosen, and rectangles drawn meanwhile queued up more of them.
- The settings window follows Windows 11 Settings: neutral colours, plain 20 DIP icons, 14 / 12 px text and On / Off captions beside every switch; the slogans, the banner picture and the tinted sidebar are gone. Fluent and Liquid Glass are picked from two preview tiles that show the icon size, tint and Chameleon settings live. Icon tint and fence tint are colour swatches; alignment guides and the Peek hotkey sit under the switch they depend on and turn grey while it is off. Rules are one compact row each, the quick-add templates are chips inside their card, and the new-rule form opens on demand. The fence picker heads the 「栅栏」 page, and restoring the desktop icons moved to 「故障排除」 on the About page. Chinese, Japanese and Korean text in the window uses the font of the interface language, and 「显示语言」 is listed under 「外观」 again.
- Chinese file names and titles in fences are drawn with Microsoft YaHei UI. They used to come out in the Japanese UI font, with Japanese forms of shared characters (今, 令, 骨, 直) next to YaHei for simplified-only ones. Like Explorer, fence text follows the Windows display language: Traditional Chinese uses Microsoft JhengHei UI, Japanese Yu Gothic UI, Korean Malgun Gothic, every other language YaHei.
- Select several fences by drawing a rectangle on the empty desktop: every fence it touches is selected as you draw (Ctrl or Shift adds to the selection) and gets a white outline, like the other drag feedback. Drag any selected fence by its title and the whole group moves along, keeping its layout; the group's outline snaps to the other fences and the screen edges, Esc or a right-click puts it back. A click on the desktop or on any fence ends the selection. While the desktop icons are hidden PecoFence draws the selection rectangle itself, in white too (Explorer shows none then). A rectangle that touches no fence still offers 「在此新建栅栏」, and a drag that activates the desktop from another window now counts too.
- 「鼠标悬停时才显示标题栏」 no longer leaves an empty band at the top of every fence: at rest the title row folds away and the glass starts at the icons; when the pointer arrives, the glass grows back up and the title fades in, with the icons staying where they are. The shadow and the rounded corners follow the glass.
- 「标题对齐」 (Settings › General › Appearance, `titleAlign`): fence titles and tab strips can be left-aligned, centred like in Stardock Fences, or right-aligned. Centred titles are centred on the whole fence and keep clear of the roll-up chevron.
- 「全透明」 opacity (fence options, `opacity transparent`): no glass, tint, border or shadow at rest, only icons and titles, whose text picks dark or light ink from the wallpaper and gets a halo. The glass fades in while the pointer is over the fence, while it is rolled up, floats (Peek), takes a drop or is selected with a desktop rectangle.

## 0.1.1

- Switching virtual desktops no longer blanks the fences: they slide out and in with the desktop, content and glass together, instead of disappearing for the whole animation and popping back afterwards. The other desktops' wallpapers are prepared in the background, so a fence already shows the new desktop's picture as it slides in (about 33 MB more per extra 4K wallpaper). During taskbar-thumbnail Aero Peek fences now fade like other windows.
- Less memory with Liquid Glass: on a 4K monitor with 7 fences the idle private working set drops from about 97 to 40 MB and GPU memory from about 200 to 80 MB. GPU caches are released once drawing goes quiet, the full-resolution wallpaper is kept only on the GPU, and fence shadows no longer hold their bitmap after it is shown.
- Fences no longer grow into each other: expanding a rolled fence, changing the icon size, auto height and the cell snap stop a snapping gap short of the next fence (the rest of the items scroll), and a dragged edge stops at a neighbouring fence. A fence dropped onto another one moves the shortest way to a free spot (an outline shows where while you drag), and overlaps a layout already has are pulled apart at startup (larger fences stay, smaller ones move; with no free spot a fence stays put) (#2).
- Changing a fixed-height fence's icon size fits its height to the content, so shrinking the icons no longer leaves rows of empty space (#2).
- Snapping settings now match Stardock Fences: 「移动栅栏时吸附对齐」 (keep fences lined up when moving), 「栅栏间距」 (space between fences, 0–32 px, back on the settings page) and 「调整大小时保持为整数个图标」 (`snapping.sizeToCells`, whole icon columns and rows, which was stored but did nothing). With it off (the default) a fence can be any size: the icon grid spreads its columns over the width, a fence keeps its width when the icon size changes (it used to grow or shift left) and a dragged side edge snaps to neighbouring fences' edges (#1, #2).
- Smoother icon edges: icons from the shell came with straight alpha but were drawn as premultiplied, which made anti-aliased outlines look jagged, most visibly at large sizes on dark wallpapers (#2).
- 「在桌面显示文件夹」 (Show a folder on the desktop) in the tray and fence menus shows Documents, Downloads, Pictures or any chosen folder as a live fence; the UI no longer says "portal".

Found by letting an agent organise a real desktop with the CLI:

- pecofence-cli: `item move --dry-run` (method `items.planMove`) lists per item whether only the icon changes fence (`membership`), a real file moves (`fileMove`, with `destination`), nothing happens, or it is skipped (`exists`, `notAFile`). The real move now skips files whose name already exists at the destination (`skipped` + warning) instead of opening Explorer's replace dialog on the user's screen, and says `fileMove: true` when files are still on their way.
- pecofence-cli: `fence get` / `fence list` report `fit` (columns, rows, the height that shows every item, `overflow`) for the fence each window shows; `fence fit <FENCE>` applies that height.
- pecofence-cli: when the app changes a rect on its own (auto height after `fence move/resize/fit` or `fence create --rect`, whole columns and rows after `fence set iconSize/spacing/layout/labelLines`), the reply carries `adjusted {requested, applied, reason}` instead of a silently different size.
- pecofence-cli: `fence create --below/--above/--right-of/--left-of <FENCE> [--size w,h]` places a fence next to another one with aligned edges and the snapping gap, refuses rects that leave the work area and warns about overlaps.
- pecofence-cli: global `--fields id,title,rect.w` keeps only those keys (no jq needed) and `--ascii` writes non-ASCII as `\uXXXX`, for readers that decode stdout with the ANSI code page (Python on a Chinese or Japanese system, Windows PowerShell 5).
- pecofence-cli: `item list` reports `shortcutArguments`, so the same program started with other arguments no longer looks like a duplicate.
- pecofence-cli: a folder portal that has been navigated into a subfolder reports it as `portal.current`; `item list` shows that folder and `item move` to the portal puts files there.
- pecofence-cli: a hosted tab's `rect` is now its host window's (it was the tab's stale own geometry, which made fences look overlapped); snapshots report `fenceCount` for the current monitors (it used to sum every monitor layout, e.g. 21 for 7 fences).
- pecofence-cli: the hint for a rule without conditions names `describe --schema Cond` (it named a command that does not exist).
- `snapping.gapPx` now sets the gap fences keep while snapping (it was stored but ignored; the gap was always 8 DIP). `snapping.sizeToCells` and `snapping.guideLines` are still unused; setting them over the CLI returns a warning.

## 0.1.0

- New `pecofence-cli` (on PATH in the Store package as `pecofence-cli.exe`): terminals, scripts and coding agents control fences, items, rules, snapshots, config export/import and backups over a local named pipe; JSON output, `describe` for the full command and schema reference.
- pecofence-cli: `item list` reports `kind`, `ext`, `size`, `modified`, `created`, `openCount`, `lastOpened`, `shortcutTarget`, `fileName` and the filing `rule` for every item (`--kind` / `--ext` filters), so an agent can sort a desktop without opening files.
- pecofence-cli: `item rename <ITEM> <NAME>` renames the file behind an icon (extension kept unless `--keep-ext false`).
- pecofence-cli: `rule apply --dry-run` lists the moves the rules would make without making them; `rule apply` now reports the same `moves` list.
- pecofence-cli: `item move` of 20 or more desktop items takes an automatic layout snapshot first (`snapshotId`), like `fence delete` and `rule apply`.
- pecofence-cli: `watch` streams desktop events (`item.added/removed/moved`, `fence.created/deleted/changed`, heartbeat) over a long-lived pipe connection; `--fence`, `--events`, `--once` for scripts that wait for one change and then run a batch.
- pecofence-cli: offline `config check [FILE]` validates and lints a config file (rule targets, portal folders, tab hosts, `$schema`), `paths` shows where config, backups, log and crash dumps live, `log [-f] [-n]` prints or follows the app log.
- `config.json` and exports start with a `$schema` field pointing at the published JSON Schema (`describe --schema Config`).
- About 430 KB smaller `pecofence.exe`: `RUST_LOG` now takes `level` and `target=level` directives (for example `pecofence=debug`) without span or field filters, so the regex engine is no longer linked in.
- Start with Windows now follows the release you launch: an entry still pointing at an older copy (for example one left in Downloads) is re-pointed to the running executable.

## 0.0.5

- Fence corners are 8 DIP in both materials (Fluent was 4, Liquid Glass 24), matching Windows 11 windows. Title-bar controls follow.
- Settings: the Liquid Glass switch is 44×24 instead of the oversized 54×30.

## 0.0.4

- Fence context menu → Sort → "Group by date": items are shown under Today / Yesterday / This week / This month / Earlier headers in the icon, list and details layouts.
- Settings → Organizing rules → Quick add: one click creates a fence and its rule for Images, Music, Videos, Archives, Installers, or "To clean up" (installers and archives unused for 30 days; gathered, never deleted).
- New rule condition "idle days": the item was neither modified nor opened from a fence for N days. Rules using it are re-run hourly.
- New file type category "Installers": .msi/.msix/.appx packages and setup/install-named .exe files.
- Consistent app icon: Store tiles, exe icon, taskbar icon, tray icon and the settings window share the white-on-indigo mark.

## 0.0.2

- While Windows desktop icons are hidden, the special desktop items the user has enabled in Windows (Recycle Bin, This PC, User's Files, Network, Control Panel) appear in the Desktop fence: double-click opens them, the shell context menu works (Empty Recycle Bin, Properties), files dropped on the Recycle Bin are recycled, and the Recycle Bin icon follows its contents (also when files are recycled from elsewhere).
- Version bump for the Microsoft Store resubmission; package identity requires a new version per upload.
- Executables link the C runtime statically; the Visual C++ Redistributable is no longer required (Store policy 10.2.4.1).
- License changed from MIT to the Apache License 2.0; a NOTICE file accompanies the LICENSE.

## 0.0.1

- Renamed the product, executables and packages to PecoFence; existing configuration
  directories, environment overrides and startup entries are handled compatibly.
- Desktop fences, folder portals, tab groups, Explorer file operations and sorting.
- Quick Hide, Peek, Fluent and Liquid Glass themes.
- Automatic organizing rules, layout snapshots, configuration import/export and backups.
- Ten offline interface languages with live switching and Windows display-language detection.
- README and hero artwork in all ten languages under `docs/readme/`.
- Static product website in `site/`, built by `scripts/build-site.py` and published with GitHub Pages.
- Shared native/settings translation catalogs and translation validation.
- Portable x64 packaging, clean source export and draft GitHub Release workflow.
- Portable startup preserves the installed copy's Windows autostart registration.
- Independent instances use separate WebView2 profiles.

This is an initial release. Full compatibility testing across older Windows 11
versions and different graphics/display configurations is still in progress.
