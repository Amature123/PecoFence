# Upgrading to PecoFence

PecoFence is the new name of this project. The executable is now `pecofence.exe`,
with `pecofence-watchdog.exe` beside it.

## Existing installations

Exit the older openFence application before starting PecoFence. Both names share
a compatibility instance lock so two versions cannot manage the same desktop at once.

New installations save configuration in `%APPDATA%\PecoFence`. If that location
has no configuration or backups and `%APPDATA%\OpenFence` contains an existing
installation, PecoFence continues using the old directory **in place**. Nothing
is copied or rewritten simply to change the product name. Existing PecoFence data
always takes priority.

This preserves fence layouts, rules, language preferences, snapshots and backups.
Filenames and custom fence/rule names are not renamed. Portable mode continues
using the `config` directory beside the executable.

New logs and WebView2 profiles use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\PecoFence`. An outstanding
desktop-icon recovery marker from the older name is recognized.

## Switching between the ZIP and the installer

Releases offer `pecofence-v<version>-x64-portable.zip` and
`pecofence-v<version>-x64-setup.exe`, with the same program inside. Both keep
settings in `%APPDATA%\PecoFence`, so switching keeps your fences, rules and
settings. Exit PecoFence from its tray menu first.

- **ZIP to installer:** run the setup EXE. It can install into the folder you
  extracted the ZIP into and replaces the program files there. If you install
  somewhere else, you can delete the old ZIP folder afterwards.
- **Installer to ZIP:** uninstall through Windows Settings (your data is kept),
  then extract the ZIP and run `pecofence.exe`.
- If you started the ZIP with `--portable`, its configuration is in the `config`
  folder beside the executable, which other copies do not read. Use **Export or
  import configuration** in Settings to carry it over.

## Windows startup

A normal release launch registers the `PecoFence` startup entry when required.
The legacy `openFence` entry is removed only after a replacement was registered
successfully, or when startup is disabled. When startup is on, the running release
points the entry at its own executable, so the copy that ran last starts with Windows.

Portable and development launches do not change startup entries. Changing the
autostart switch in Settings remains an explicit opt-in/out.

## Environment overrides

Use the `PECOFENCE_` prefix for application overrides, for example `PECOFENCE_INSTANCE` and
`PECOFENCE_ACRYLIC`. Existing `OPENFENCE_` overrides are still accepted; when both
are defined, the `PECOFENCE_` value wins.
